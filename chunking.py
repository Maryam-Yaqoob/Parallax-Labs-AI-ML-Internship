-----------
Stage 1 (Task 2): Recursive text chunking strategy for the cleaned
20 Newsgroups dataset (processed_dataset.csv from Task 1).

Chunking strategy
------------------
Uses **recursive character splitting**: text is split by trying a list of
separators in order of "semantic size" (biggest/most natural break first),
falling back to smaller separators only where needed:

    1. "\n\n"  -> paragraph breaks
    2. "\n"    -> line breaks
    3. ". "    -> sentence breaks
    4. " "     -> word breaks
    5. ""      -> hard character split (last resort, guarantees termination)

For each candidate separator, the text is split into pieces, and pieces are
greedily packed together until adding the next piece would exceed
CHUNK_SIZE. If a single piece is still bigger than CHUNK_SIZE (e.g. one
giant paragraph with no periods), the next separator down the list is tried
recursively on that piece. This is the same core idea as LangChain's
RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter, reimplemented here directly so there's no
extra dependency.

Overlap: consecutive chunks share CHUNK_OVERLAP characters of context
(taken from the end of the previous chunk), which helps semantic search
retrieve chunks even when the relevant sentence sits right at a chunk
boundary.

Defaults chosen for this task: CHUNK_SIZE=1000, CHUNK_OVERLAP=100
(~10% overlap), which is a reasonable balance for 20 Newsgroups-style
posts (short-to-medium length, mostly plain text).

    Recursively splits `text` into chunks of at most ~chunk_size characters,
    with chunk_overlap characters shared between consecutive chunks.

    Implementation is two separate passes:
    1. `_split_into_pieces` recursively breaks the text down into small,
       "atomic" pieces (each already <= chunk_size wherever possible) —
       this pass never merges anything, so nothing can compound over
       chunk_size across recursion levels.
    2. `_merge_pieces` does a single greedy merge pass over those atomic
       pieces to pack them into chunk_size-sized chunks with overlap.

    Edge cases handled:
    - None / non-string input -> returns []
    - empty or whitespace-only string -> returns []
    - text shorter than chunk_size -> returns a single chunk (the whole text)
    - chunk_overlap >= chunk_size -> treated as chunk_overlap = 0 (avoids
      infinite loops / non-progress)
