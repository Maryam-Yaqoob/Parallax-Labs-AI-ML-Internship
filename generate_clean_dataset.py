--------------------------
Stage 4 (final step): Applies text_cleaning.py to the full raw dataset
(data_raw.csv from Stage 2), producing:

  - processed_dataset.csv   : cleaned dataset, ready for chunking/embedding
  - data_quality_report.md  : before/after quality report

Requires data_raw.csv to already exist (run load_and_validate_dataset.py first).

Run:
